### Built With:

Ruby on Rails

### Features:

Once the user is signed in (with authentication), they may search for upcoming concerts either by artist name or by venue name. The user can then add tickets to their cart and purchase the tickets, which will reduce the money in their wallet. The user may also sell tickets to get the money back.
